# IAMMOKZEEEE.github.io

Welcome to my coding portfolio website! This website is a showcase of my coding projects, blog posts, and a contact form to reach me.

## Description

### Sections

#### The Beginning
The header section of the website contains the main heading, as well as a navigation menu that allows you to quickly jump to other sections of the page.

#### A Peek Into My World
The About Me section provides a brief overview of who I am, my background, and my interests.

#### What I'm Working On
The What I'm Working On section showcases my current coding projects. It features 5 bootstrap cards that provide a brief summary of each project and a button that links to a separate project page. The project pages contain the title of the project, an in-depth description of the project, and a working web-app example if available.

#### The Time Capsule
The Time Capsule section is a searchable list of my previous coding projects. It includes a search bar and filters that allow you to sort the projects by code language. Each project has a button that links to a separate project page with more details.

#### Byte-Sized Insights
The Byte-Sized Insights section is a blog that features my latest thoughts on programming and technology. It is an RSS feed to a Jekyll page, with a home button that redirects back to the Byte-Sized Insights section of index.html.

#### Byte Buddy
The Byte Buddy section is a contact form where you can reach out to me. It includes four input fields: First Name, Last Name, Company, Email Address, and a text area for your message. All input fields are required except for Company. The form submission is handled by an un-static form manager.

### Offcanvas Sidebar Menu
The website includes an offcanvas sidebar menu that provides quick links to different sections of the website. The menu button is fixed in the top right-hand corner of the website and is signified by three horizontal circles.

### Home Button
All pages have a home button in the top-right corner with a purple background and a white house icon. This button allows you to quickly return to the corresponding section of index.html.
